# FX68K Instruction Implementation Details

## M68000 Instruction Processing Overview

The FX68K implements M68000 instructions through a sophisticated process of breaking down each instruction into microcode sequences, which are further implemented through nanocode operations. This document provides detailed examples of how instructions are processed.

## ROM Access and Control Flow

### From Instruction to Execution

Let's follow a complete example of how an instruction is processed through the microcode and nanocode ROMs:

#### Example: ADD.W D1,D0 (Add D1 to D0)

```
Instruction Word: 0xD040
[15:12] = 1101 (ADD operation)
[11:9]  = 000 (Register direct mode)
[8:6]   = 001 (D1 source register)
[5:3]   = 000 (D0 destination register)
[2:0]   = 000 (Word size)

1. Initial Decode and ROM Access:

a) PLA Translation:
   Input: 0xD040
   Output: Microcode entry point 0x180 (example address)

b) Microcode ROM Access (17-bit words):
   Address 0x180: 10010000101100000
   Decoded as:
   [16:14] = 100 (Next address sequential)
   [13:11] = 100 (ALU ADD operation)
   [10:8]  = 001 (Register source)
   [7:4]   = 0110 (Register dest)
   [3:0]   = 0000 (No special control)

c) Nanocode ROM Access (68-bit word):
   Address determined by microcode: 0x045
   Content: 00100001000000011000010001001000000110100000000001000000011001001001
   Decoded as:
   [67:64] = 0010 (Register operation)
   [63:48] = 0001000000011000 (Source register control)
   [47:32] = 0100010010000001 (ALU setup)
   [31:16] = 1010000000000100 (Result routing)
   [15:0]  = 0000011001001001 (Control flags)

2. Execution Sequence:

Clock Cycle 1 (T1):
- Microcode 0x180 activates
- Nanocode signals:
  * reg2dbl = 1 (D1 to data bus)
  * aluInit = 1 (Prepare ALU)

Clock Cycle 2 (T2):
- Next microcode word activates
- Nanocode controls:
  * dbd2Alue = 1 (Data to ALU)
  * aluColumn = 100 (ADD operation)

Clock Cycle 3 (T3):
- ALU operation completes
- Result routing:
  * alu2Dbd = 1 (ALU to data bus)
  * dbl2reg = 1 (Data bus to D0)

Clock Cycle 4 (T4):
- CCR update
- Next instruction fetch begins
```

#### Example: MOVE.W (A0)+,D1 (Post-increment addressing)

```
Instruction Word: 0x3218
[15:12] = 0011 (MOVE operation)
[11:9]  = 001 (D1 destination)
[8:6]   = 011 (Post-increment mode)
[5:3]   = 000 (A0 source register)
[2:0]   = 000 (Word size)

1. ROM Access Sequence:

a) PLA Output: Microcode entry 0x140

b) Microcode Sequence (showing multiple words):
   0x140: 10000100000000000 (Setup address)
   0x141: 00101001011010000 (Memory read)
   0x142: 00111110011000000 (Post-increment)
   0x143: 01000000000001100 (Store result)

c) Nanocode Examples:
   For address setup:
   00000001100000000010100000001000000110000000001001000000001001001001
   Decoded for address setup:
   - reg2abl = 1 (A0 to address bus)
   - permStart = 1 (Start bus cycle)

2. Execution Flow:

T1 State (Address Setup):
- A0 contents â†’ Address Bus
- Start memory cycle
- Enable bus control

T2 State (Memory Read):
- Wait for DTACK
- Capture data
- Route to internal bus

T3 State (Post-increment):
- Increment A0
- Store new A0 value
- Route data to D1

T4 State (Completion):
- Update CCR
- Prepare next fetch
```

### Microcode Word Format Details

```

## Instruction Decoding Process

### 1. Initial Decode
```
Instruction Word (16 bits)

[11:9]  - Register/Mode Field
[8:6]   - Addressing Mode
[5:3]   - Register Number
[2:0]   - Size/Additional Info
```

### 2. Address PLA Translation
The uaddrPla module translates instruction patterns into microcode entry points:

```verilog
// Example from uaddrPla.sv
wire [3:0] mainOp = Ir[15:12];
wire [2:0] subOp = Ir[11:9];
wire [2:0] mode = Ir[8:6];
wire [2:0] reg = Ir[5:3];
```
