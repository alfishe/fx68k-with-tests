# FX68K Microcode and Nanocode Implementation

## Microcode Architecture

The FX68K uses a sophisticated microcode and nanocode architecture to implement the M68000 instruction set. This document details the structure and operation of both control levels.

### Microcode ROM Structure

The microcode ROM has the following characteristics:
- Width: 17 bits
- Depth: 1024 words
- Address width: 10 bits

The microcode word format is used to control high-level instruction sequencing and operation flow. Each bit in the microcode word has specific control functions that drive the nanocode selection and execution flow.

### Nanocode ROM Structure

The nanocode ROM has these specifications:
- Width: 68 bits
- Depth: 336 words
- Address width: 9 bits

The nanocode provides detailed control signals for the CPU's datapath operations. Each bit in the nanocode word controls specific hardware elements.

## Microcode Operation

### Instruction Mapping

The microcode ROM is addressed through several mechanisms:
1. Direct opcode mapping via the uaddrPla
2. Sequential execution within instruction routines
3. Exception and interrupt vectors

### Control Flow

Microcode sequences typically follow this pattern:
1. Initial decode and setup
2. Operand fetch
3. Operation execution
4. Result storage
5. Next instruction preparation

## Nanocode Implementation

### Nanocode Fields

The 68-bit nanocode word contains multiple control fields:

1. Bus Control Signals:
```
permStart       - Start bus cycle
waitBusFinish   - Wait for bus completion
isWrite         - Write cycle control
busByte         - Byte operation control
isRmc           - Read-Modify-Write cycle
```

2. Register Control:
```
reg2abl, reg2abh - Register to address bus
reg2dbl, reg2dbh - Register to data bus
abh2reg, abl2reg - Address bus to register
dbh2reg, dbl2reg - Data bus to register
```

3. ALU Control:
```
aluColumn       - ALU operation selection
aluDctrl        - Data input control
aluActrl        - Address input control
aluInit         - Initialize ALU operation
aluFinish       - Complete ALU operation
```

4. Special Operations:
```
updTpend, clrTpend - Trace pending control
tvn2Ftu, const2Ftu - Function unit control
ftu2Dbl, ftu2Abl   - Function unit output routing
```

### Datapath Control

The nanocode controls these major datapath elements:

1. Bus Operations:
- Internal/external bus transfers
- Byte/word operations
- Address/data routing

2. Register Operations:
- General purpose register access
- Address register operations
- Special register handling

3. ALU Functions:
- Arithmetic operations
- Logical operations
- Shift/rotate control

## Instruction Implementation

### Example: ADD Instruction

The ADD instruction implementation shows how microcode and nanocode work together:

1. Microcode sequence:
```
- Fetch operands
- Setup ALU operation
- Execute addition
- Store result
- Update CCR
```

2. Nanocode control:
```
- Configure source operand routing
- Select ALU addition operation
- Control result storage
- Handle CCR updates
```

### Exception Handling

Exception processing uses dedicated microcode sequences:

1. Exception Entry:
```
- Save current state
- Load exception vector
- Switch to supervisor mode
- Begin exception handler
```

2. Exception Return:
```
- Restore saved state
- Return to user mode
- Resume normal execution
```

## Timing and Synchronization

### Clock Phases

The microcode and nanocode execution is synchronized with internal clock phases:
- T1: Instruction setup
- T2: Operand fetch
- T3: Execute
- T4: Result write

### Bus Timing

Bus operations are coordinated through:
- Address strobe timing
- Data strobe control
- DTACK synchronization
- VPA handling

## Debug and Development

### Microcode Debugging

The microcode can be debugged through:
1. Instruction tracing
2. State monitoring
3. Condition code checking

### Nanocode Verification

Nanocode operations can be verified by:
1. Datapath signal monitoring
2. Bus operation tracking
3. Register transfer checking

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Paths

Key timing considerations include:
1. ALU operation completion
2. Bus cycle timing
3. Exception processing
4. Interrupt acknowledgment

### Resource Usage

The implementation requires:
1. Microcode ROM: 17Kb
2. Nanocode ROM: 22.8Kb
3. PLA and decode logic
4. Control state registers

## Optimization Considerations
